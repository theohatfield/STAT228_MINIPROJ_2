## Learn to Wrangle (Struggle with LearnR)
This project was super fun and I took inspiration from the real life activity... wranglin snakes! It's not as adrenaline producing, but I will definitely say data wrangling can be just as intimidating if you don't know where to start. This was super fun to make and I even tried playing around with learnR. Unfortunately knitting was not so successful as it could not produce a reproducable and non-static HTML from the RMarkdown file. It works upon first running the Rmd file but saved versions of the HTML are either static or the formatting of the page is skewed. To use the functional app uploaded to shiny.io use the link in the read me file!!
